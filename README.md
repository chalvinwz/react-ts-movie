## Project from FreeCodeCamp Tutorial

This is a project from a tutorial on [FreeCodeCamp Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTeuhbP7wdE). We build an application where user can see popular movies, the information about a movie and the actors, etc. I really enjoyed this tutorial and learned a lot of new things from there.

##### What I have learned from this tutorial:

<li> React hooks
<li> Custom hooks
<li> How to work with typescript in React
<li> Styled-components
<li> API consume, fetching data from API
<li> Deploying react application to netlify
