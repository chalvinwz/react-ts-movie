## Project from FreeCodeCamp Tutorial

This is a project from a tutorial on [FreeCodeCamp Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTeuhbP7wdE). We build an application where user can see popular movies, the information about a movie and the actors, etc. I really enjoyed this tutorial and learned a lot of new things from there.

##### What I have learned from this tutorial:

- React hooks
- Custom hooks
- How to work with typescript in React
- Styled-components
- API consume, fetching data from API
- Deploying react application to netlify
